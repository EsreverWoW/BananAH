	Known bugs
- Undercut sometimes matchs the lowest price if you're already selling a similar item.
- High CPU usage.
- Sometimes scanned auctions report a stack size of 1. This was a known bug of the API that was fixed on 29th February, but the fix may haven't been applied to Korean & Russian shards yet.
- When you try to post without any empty slot in your bags, the posting queue may block until relogging, throwing a lot of errors.
